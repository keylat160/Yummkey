           1. We make the batter for the chicken first by mixing flour, egg, garlic salt, paprika, pepper and water. Add the chicken into the batter. Give it a stir to coat.
           2.Then we fry the chicken in a wok in the hot oil. My pro tip is to fry the chicken in 2 or 3 batches – this ensures all of the chicken will be lovely and crispy.
           3.Remove from the pan and carefully discard the oil.
           (for the sauce)
           4.The orange sauce is made from a mixture of the orange juice and zest, sugar/honey, soy sauce, garlic and rice vinegar.
           5.Add the sauce in the wok until slightly thickened then add the chicken and tossed in the sauce until fully coated and serve.

           <h3>
            Directions:
           </h3>
           <p>
           1.Place the Guajillo and Ancho chiles in a bowl full of near-boiling water. Allow the peppers to soak for at least 10 minutes.
           2.While the peppers soak, season the chuck roast chunks with salt and pepper to taste.
           3.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. In 2 batches, sear the roast on all sides, using more oil as needed. Transfer the seared chuck roast to a plate and set aside. Add the remaining oil, tomatoes, onion, and garlic to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
           4.Transfer the hydrated chiles from the bowl of water to the pot. Add the short ribs and spices. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, and maintain a gentle simmer for 30 minutes.
           5.Remove the short ribs and add to the plate with the seared roast. Skim the top of the pot to remove any impurities from the bone cooking out. Remove the cinnamon stick and discard. Transfer about 1 ½ – 2 cups of the braising liquid to a bowl. Cover the bowl and refrigerate.Use an immersion blender to blend the remaining pepper and tomato mixture until smooth.
           6.Return the short ribs, seared beef, and any juices back to the Dutch oven. Add the apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for at least 3-4 hours.
           7.Remove the reserved braising liquid from the refrigerator. Working 1 tortilla at a time, dip the tortilla in the reserved liquid. Place the tortilla on a large skillet set over medium heat.
           8.Top half of the tortilla with 1-2 tablespoons of shredded cheese, 2-3 tablespoons of shredded beef, and a sprinkle of onion and cilantro. Fold the tortilla in half to close.
           9.Cook the tacos for 30-45 seconds on each side until crisp. Transfer to a serving platter and squeeze fresh lime juice over the top and serve.
